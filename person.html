											<h3>Biography</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											Steve Wozniak, byname of Stephen Gary Wozniak, is an American computer scientist born in California in the family of an electronic engineer. Even in his youth, his father gave him his passion for technology. In elementary school, little Wozniak receives a license to manufacture radio equipment, and already in the middle grades he wins a competition from the BBC by collecting a sophisticated scientific calculator.
											During his work at the University of California at Berkeley, through a mutual friend, Steve Wozniak met Steve Jobs, who at that time was still in school. They later teamed up to found Apple Computer on April 1, 1976.
											Working in a family garage, he and Jobs tried to create a computer with a more convenient interface than the IBM computers offered at that time. Wozniak came up with products, and Jobs advertised them. Shortly after setting up the company, Wozniak created the Apple I computer, which was mostly designed in Jobs’s bedroom and garage. With Wozniak's knowledge and the ability to sell Jobs, they were perfect for a joint venture. Wozniak wanted the next version of the computer - "Apple II" - to be mass-produced by the company, and thanks to this, by 1983 the total price of the company's shares was 985 million US dollars.

											<h3>Ukraine in his life</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											Steve Wozniak's father, a talented engineer, is originally from Bukovina and his mother is a native of Germany. The family moved to the United States after the war. Little Steve was born in August 1950 in California.
											Steve himself considers himself Ukrainian. He said this while speaking at a cybersecurity forum in Kyiv. "Many ask me, Steve, are you a Pole? Because my name is Wozniak. I answer: no, I'm Ukrainian!"
											According to him, all his life he dreamed of visiting the Ukrainian capital. Moreover, he noted that the visit to Ukraine was one of the most expected for him. "All my life I wanted to come to Ukraine. In particular to Kyiv. In my life, I planned to do four things, one of which is to come to Kyiv."

									<h3><a href="#">He’s a Hollywood Triple Threat</a></h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									When he’s not tapping his creativity to design world-changing devices, Woz has acted, danced, and even sung. His appearance on the Big Bang Theory  referenced his Fred Astaire-like moves on Dancing with the Stars, and during the 1982 US Festival – a massive Labor Day weekend event Woz coordinated that aimed to bring together music and technology – he joined the stage with country music singer Jerry Jeff Walker, belting out a tune for the crowd.

									<h3><a href="#">The Apple I Was Not His First Computer</a></h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									It’s an often misconception that Woz’s first computer design was the Apple I, to be followed by the wildly successful Apple II. Woz’s first computer was the Cream Soda Computer, a small circuit board that allowed connectors to plug in and chips to be soldered in. The computer got his name from cream sodas he and a neighborhood friend would enjoy while they worked on the machine.

									<h3><a href="#">But He Can Fib … for Fun</a></h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									Once when questioned by the Secret Service and asked for identification, Woz showed a fake ID he had made. It claimed he was the "Laser Safety Officer" at the "Department of Defiance" in an arc, in a font that looked like "Department of Defense" to the quick glance. On it was a photo of Woz with an eye patch. What was he questioned by the Secret Service for? A pad of $2 bills that he had (legally) printed and was attempting to pay with while in Las Vegas.
